## **Step 3**
* Now that you have VSCode and your terminal, what you want to do now is type in **ssh cs15lsp22(UserName)@ieng6.ucsd.edu** 
* The (UserName) should be your own unique username or else it won't work.
* Then you want to enter in your own password that you created upon activating this account.
